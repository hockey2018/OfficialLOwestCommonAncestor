# OfficialLOwestCommonAncestor
I was talking to Professor Stephen Barrett and he suggested that I create a new repository and put all my code form the lowest common ancestor assignment here. 
I have had numerous problems with linking my eclipse accout to github and have talked to him about it on my occasions. 
He told me that I could put all the code from the assignent here and that the commits and staging from Lowest-Common-Ancestor https://github.com/hockey2018/Lowest-Common-Ancestor-1.git would be taken into account. 
When you look at the assignment history you can see the different commits however when you look for the file it has been deleted. Im not sure why this was and this was when he told me to create a new respository. 
I will place all the code from the assignment here. 
Many thanks,
